    "Sorry, World!"<br>Welcome to the musings of a bat who is... sorry for... everything.
    <h1>01 i didn't mean it</h1>
    <p>Look, I mean, hi, but look, look at me. I'm just a bat. Doin' my bat thang.</p>
    <p>I didn't CHOOSE to go to market. It's crowded in there, and I like to... spread my wings out, y'know what I mean? I don't mind getting cozy with friends, but holy cow, there are limits!</p>
    <p>I didn't CHOOSE to spread whatever I had to ANY of you. I don't even like people. Or other animals... I like doing m'own thang, y'know what I mean?</p>
    <p>I didn't KNOW I... had whatever I... had. And whatever it is, I probably got it from Steve a couple of trees down the way! He's always sharing... over-sharing... freakin' Steve.</p>
    <p>Look, nobody likes me any more, and... I get it. And... I've come to peace with that. In fact, I'm owning it! You HATE me! And, again, I get it.</p>
    <p>But you should know something: there's more to me than how I caused... uh, well... everything.</p>
