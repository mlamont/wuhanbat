# wuhanbat
"The musings of a bat who is sorry for everything."

## the why / prioritized goals
1. I want to **playfully write**. For this project, I shall explore via a character of a bat from Wuhan, China, who is sorry for inadvertently causing the COVID-19 global pandemic.
2. I want to **learn ENS**. For this project, I shall explore the Ethereum Name Service, its fields, and its capabilities via sub-domains.
3. I want to **make money**. For this project, I shall explore how to profit using ENS NFTs.

## the how / principled stances
- I want to be **gut-led**. I want to be moved by an internal pull of glee or profundity.
- I want to feel like I'm **personally growing**. I want to either be putting in the effort, or feel like I'm gaining a capability, or see the fruits of my labour.
- I want to **cultivate community**. I want to keep an eye towards not just individual development, but to also think about how my actions might enrich a group of people who coalesce around this project.

## the what / itertive increments
- This is a **writing platform**. Starting with one for myself, this may evolve to be one for fans to create fan fiction.
- This is an **exploration avenue**. Starting with ENS, this will likely fold in other aspects of Web3 technology and culture.
- This is a **monitization platform**. Starting with one for myself, this may evolve to be one for fan fiction writers.
