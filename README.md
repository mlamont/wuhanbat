# wuhanbat
"The musings of a bat who is sorry for everything."

## the why / prioritized goals
1. I want to **playfully write**. For this project, I shall explore via a character of a bat from Wuhan, China, who is sorry for inadvertently causing the COVID-19 global pandemic.
2. I want to **learn ENS**. For this project, I shall explore the Ethereum Name Service, its fields, and its capabilities via sub-domains.
3. I want to **make money**. For this project, I shall explore how to profit using ENS NFTs.

## the how / principled stances
- I want to be **gut-led**. I want to be moved by an internal pull of glee or profundity.
- I want to feel like I'm **personally growing**.
